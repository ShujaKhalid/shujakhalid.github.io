            <p class="lead">Hi! My name is Shuja Khalid and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) at the University of Toronto where my focus is Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I received my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Mechatronics from the University of Toronto. Over the years I have worked on a variety of different projects such as mobile/web applications, front-end design, image processing algorithms, computer vision algorithms, machine learning algorithms etc. The purpose of this site is to provide some context for these projects and to capture some of my lessons learned. </p>

            <p class="lead">Background</p>
            <p>
            The aim of this project was to identify traffic lanes in an image. Once a methodology was successfully adopted to identify lanes in a given image, the algorithm was extended to a video. This project was part of the Udacity self-driving car nanodegree program and was the first time that I incorporated both thresholding techniques and the opencv package to build a lane detection algorithm. The videos below illustrate the strength of this technique:

	      <p class="lead"> Lessons Learned </p>
	      Lane detection is an extremely challenging topic and succeptible to error. In my opinion, the most important characteristic is thresholding. When considering only a portion of the image, environmental factors such as lack of natural light can be extremely challenging. 

	      Fine-tuning the parameters to work for each video was very time consuming. Developing a more robust model that can easily adapt to such factors would be the natural next step.

            I am an avid sports fan and love hockey. While working on a university project, I decided to incorporate my two passions, computer science and hockey! I hope you enjoy this website and the tools it has to offer. I am dedicated to this website and will continue to improve my models/algorithms and add more features to it. This is an exciting new age in sports and I am hoping to contribute in any way I can.

            <p>
            This project was one of the most interesting projects that I have worked on. Not only did I learn about web-scraping and fine-tuning different regression based models, I realized that there are a no. of gaps that exist in the sports world today with regards to statistics. A tool to assess the availability of players is of paramount importance but do current statistics really consider the effect of physical attributes to project player performance? How can one quantify the performance of a player if there isn't significant data available? The PAR (Player Availability Rating) attempts to solve theis exact issue. An in depth analysis of the methods used to produce this rating are presented in the following paper:

            <p class="lead">Background</p>
			<p> The purpose of the project is to create a scalable cloud-based web application that can automatically scale itself to adjust to fluctuating user demand. Although Amazon already provides such services, this application provides insight about the level of detail that is required to construct and maintain truly scalable applications. The application should also have the ability to apply transformations to user defined images using the Python based tool ImageMagick.

            <p class="lead">Background</p>
            As part of the curriculum for ECE1779 (Introduction to Cloud Computing), students were tasked with creating a web-application using AWS Lambda. The project that I worked on is called Majority Rules!
            and is something that I had been thinking of incorporating for quite some time. The application is a social networking web-applicaiton that aims to decrease the divide that exists among individuals by generating constructive discussion. Users are then given the option to voice their approval or disapproval on issues. The results of the tallies is important as they give the world a sense of how the majority of the public feels about issues that have global consequences.

   			Incorporating the web-application using AWS Lambda was a painless task. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to launch their own web-application. Operating costs are also minimal.

            <p class="lead">Background</p>
            <p>
            The aim of the project- ‘Trip Story’ is to create a Rebus Story (picture story) App that allows children to form their personalized stories by answering a series of questions. These questions are designed to be engaging and test the user’s (children age: 4+) creativity. The App provides a platform for the child to create their own stories with assistance from the parent. Upon making the correct selection, the story would continue and finally the story formed will be portrayed in the form of a Rebus story.
			The ‘Rebus story’ concept aims to promote early literacy by motivating children to participate in storytelling while also improving cognitive skills.

			During the development of the code it became apparent that the use of Realm and online
			storage was essential for the purposes of this app because of the length of the story (15
			frames) to extend it beyond the existing theme (Underwater Adventure). After some
			deliberation we decided to further learn about the aforementioned tools for this project.
			In hindsight, this type of application could have also be developed using a cross platform
			software, such as Phone Gap. Animation could have been incorporated using JavaScript,
			activity pages replaced with HTML pages and the data would still be stored in Realm and
			Firebase.
